Hello there Mr Daniel. I am very sorry for the inconvinience. I am Lishebo Lishebo, a junior developer from Zambia. 
I want to update the OpenMRS Radilogy module but I need quite a bit of help with some things.
The documentation about OpenMRS is very old and I plan on updating a lot of it once I have the right full knowledge.
Having updated documentation and updated video content will nake thing s easier for many people who want to join and make significant contributions like myself.
I really need some help from you.
Please contact me on lishebolishebo100@gmail.com
